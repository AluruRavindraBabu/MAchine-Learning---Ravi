This is a project work from Data Camp:

Business Problem: 
Using a dataset comprised of songs of two music genres (Hip-Hop and Rock)
Need to train a classifier to distinguish between the two genres based only on track information derived from Echonest (now part of Spotify).

Project Tasks: 
1 Preparing dataset
2 Pairwise relationships between continuous variables
3 Normalizing the feature data
4 Principal Component Analysis on our scaled data
5 Further visualization of PCA
6 Train a decision tree to classify genre
7 Compare our decision tree to a logistic regression
8 Balance our data for greater performance
9 Does balancing our dataset improve model bias?
10 Using cross-validation to evaluate our models
