Supervised Learning : The goal of the Supervised learning to predict the Target variable based on historical / Experimental Data. 


Naming Convensions:-

Features == Predictor variables == Independent Variables

Target Variables == dependent variables == Response Variables. 


Once decide to leverage supervised machine learning to solve a problem, 
Need to identify whether the problem is better suited to classification or regression.

Classification works with Categorical data
Regression works with
